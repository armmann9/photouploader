# Project Changelog & Audit Remediation History

This file tracks all security, database, performance, and stability modifications across deployment remediation phases. Each entry summarizes what changed, which files were touched, why the change was made, and how to undo it if necessary.

---

## Phase 1 — Authentication & Network Security (Completed)
- **`src/app/login/page.tsx`**: Removed 1-click administrative bypass button and plaintext password hint to enforce genuine credential validation.
- **`src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts` & `src/lib/serverSession.ts`**: Introduced server-side HMAC-signed session tokens in secure HTTP-only cookies (`bpscvs_session_token`) with 7-day expiration.
- **`src/middleware.ts`**: Added Next.js server-side route middleware guarding `/admin/*` and `/studio/*` routes against unauthenticated access.
- **`src/lib/authContext.tsx`**: Replaced client-side `localStorage` role spoofing with server-side cookie verification endpoint (`/api/auth/session`).
- **`next.config.mjs`**: Restricted image proxy `remotePatterns` strictly to `images.unsplash.com` and Supabase storage domains to eliminate SSRF risks.

---

## Phase 2 — Data Integrity & Crash Prevention (Completed)
- **`src/lib/faceRecognition.ts`**: Fixed browser memory leak during bulk photo indexing by invoking `URL.revokeObjectURL()` on processed image blobs.
- **`src/lib/db.ts`**: Wrapped all browser `localStorage.setItem` invocations with a safe quota error handler (`safeLocalStorageSet`) to prevent `QuotaExceededError` crashes.
- **Scope Modification**: Safely removed resident photo upload modal and crowdsourced moderation dependencies (only admins and photographers upload photos via `BulkUploader.tsx`).

## Phase 3 — Database Management & Caching

### Item 1 & Item 2: Migration Script, Missing Tables & Row Level Security (RLS)
* **Date**: September 2026
* **Files Touched**:
  1. [`migrations/phase3_changes.sql`](file:///c:/Users/sahill/OneDrive/Desktop/photouploader/migrations/phase3_changes.sql) (New)
  2. [`supabase-schema.sql`](file:///c:/Users/sahill/OneDrive/Desktop/photouploader/supabase-schema.sql) (Modified)
* **One-Line Plain-English Summaries**:
  - `migrations/phase3_changes.sql`: Created dedicated SQL migration script for missing tables (`rsvps`, `event_analytics`, `committee_members`, `emergency_contacts`), performance indexes, and included a complete reverse rollback SQL script to undo all changes.
  - `supabase-schema.sql`: Updated master schema with missing colony tables, locked down RLS so only authenticated admins can edit/delete, and secured the `increment_event_photo_count` function with `SET search_path = public`.
* **Why**:
  - Eliminates silent database query failures when residents RSVP or when admins manage events and helplines.
  - Prevents public anonymous users from dropping or tampering with colony event data, while preserving public viewing and resident RSVP registrations.
  - Provides a self-contained, instant rollback mechanism via SQL.
* **How to Undo (Rollback)**:
  - In Supabase: Run the `DOWN / REVERSE MIGRATION` SQL block at the bottom of `migrations/phase3_changes.sql`.
  - In Git: `git revert 4240e9c`

### Item 3, Item 4 & Item 5: Column Mapping & AI Model Caching Headers
* **Date**: September 2026
* **Files Touched**:
  1. [`src/lib/db.ts`](file:///c:/Users/sahill/OneDrive/Desktop/photouploader/src/lib/db.ts) (Verified / Mapped)
  2. [`next.config.mjs`](file:///c:/Users/sahill/OneDrive/Desktop/photouploader/next.config.mjs) (Modified)
* **One-Line Plain-English Summaries**:
  - `src/lib/db.ts`: Standardized photographer contact field mapping to PostgreSQL `photographer_contact` (snake_case) in event creation and update queries.
  - `next.config.mjs`: Added HTTP response headers caching `/models/*` for 1 year (`Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`) to eliminate redundant 12MB face recognition neural net downloads.
  - `Item 3 (Indexes)`: Verified that all B-Tree and GIN indexes (`idx_photos_event_id`, `idx_photos_tags`, `idx_photos_faces`, `idx_events_slug`, `idx_rsvps_event_id`) are fully active in `migrations/phase3_changes.sql` and `supabase-schema.sql`.
* **Why**:
  - Without snake_case mapping, Supabase silently ignored `photographerContact` on event insertions.
  - Without caching headers, static 12MB neural net weights were re-fetched across sessions, consuming client bandwidth.
* **How to Undo (Rollback)**:
  - Remove `headers()` method in `next.config.mjs`.
  - In Git: `git revert fbe1a10`.

## Phase 4 — Functional Bug Fixes & Persistence

### Single Event RSVP, About Page Styling & Scope Cleanup
* **Date**: September 2026
* **Files Touched**:
  1. [`src/app/event/[id]/page.tsx`](file:///c:/Users/sahill/OneDrive/Desktop/photouploader/src/app/event/[id]/page.tsx) (Modified)
  2. [`src/app/about/page.tsx`](file:///c:/Users/sahill/OneDrive/Desktop/photouploader/src/app/about/page.tsx) (New/Styled)
  3. [`src/app/admin/page.tsx`](file:///c:/Users/sahill/OneDrive/Desktop/photouploader/src/app/admin/page.tsx) (Cleaned)
* **One-Line Plain-English Summaries**:
  - `src/app/event/[id]/page.tsx`: Connected single event page RSVP form directly to `saveRsvpRecord()` so guest meal choices, family counts, and bungalow numbers persist to Supabase / LocalStorage instead of disappearing.
  - `src/app/about/page.tsx`: Re-skinned `/about` page in Deepotsav dark emerald/gold theme with sticky navigation header (Home, Events, Admin) so visitors are never stranded.
  - `src/app/admin/page.tsx`: Cleaned out obsolete resident photo moderation queue per approved scope change (only admins/photographers upload albums via `BulkUploader`).
* **Why**:
  - Residents registering on single festival pages were not having their Mahaprasad headcount recorded.
  - The about route previously lacked navigation and matched an older light theme.
* **How to Undo (Rollback)**:
  - In Git: `git revert c844a7a`.

## Phase 5 — Codebase Cleanup & Utility Consolidation

### Component Pruning & Zip Service Consolidation
* **Date**: September 2026
* **Files Touched**:
  1. [`src/components/CloudConfigModal.tsx`](file:///c:/Users/sahill/OneDrive/Desktop/photouploader/src/components/CloudConfigModal.tsx) (Deleted)
  2. [`src/components/Footer.tsx`](file:///c:/Users/sahill/OneDrive/Desktop/photouploader/src/components/Footer.tsx) (Deleted)
  3. [`src/components/Navbar.tsx`](file:///c:/Users/sahill/OneDrive/Desktop/photouploader/src/components/Navbar.tsx) (Deleted)
  4. [`src/components/PinGate.tsx`](file:///c:/Users/sahill/OneDrive/Desktop/photouploader/src/components/PinGate.tsx) (Deleted)
  5. [`src/lib/zipService.ts`](file:///c:/Users/sahill/OneDrive/Desktop/photouploader/src/lib/zipService.ts) (Consolidated)
  6. [`src/app/studio/page.tsx`](file:///c:/Users/sahill/OneDrive/Desktop/photouploader/src/app/studio/page.tsx) (Connected to real `BulkUploader`)
* **One-Line Plain-English Summaries**:
  - Pruned dead/unreferenced components (`CloudConfigModal`, `Footer`, `Navbar`, `PinGate`, `FaceMatchFinder`, `SocietyTechGuide`) to reduce bundle size and maintainer confusion.
  - Consolidated dual zip utilities into a single authoritative `zipService.ts` module with backwards-compatible re-exports.
  - Replaced the mock photo uploader simulation on `/studio` with the real `BulkUploader` component.
* **Why**:
  - Eliminates ~55KB of dead code and duplicate zip implementations identified in the pre-deployment audit.
  - Enables media teams to upload real high-res albums directly from the photographer studio.
* **How to Undo (Rollback)**:
  - In Git: `git revert affc3c8`.

## Phase 6 — Cloudflare Production Readiness & Security Hardening

### Step 1: Production Security Headers & Edge Image Delivery
* **Date**: September 2026
* **Files Touched**:
  1. [`next.config.mjs`](file:///c:/Users/sahill/OneDrive/Desktop/photouploader/next.config.mjs) (Modified)
* **One-Line Plain-English Summaries**:
  - Added strict HTTP security headers (`X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, `Permissions-Policy: camera=(self)`) and enabled `unoptimized: true` on images for direct Cloudflare CDN edge delivery.
* **Why**:
  - Protects visitors against clickjacking, MIME sniffing, and unauthorized camera access.
  - Eliminates server-side image resizing proxy vulnerabilities (DoS CVE GHSA-9g9p-9gw9-jx7f) so images serve straight from Cloudflare CDN edge.
* **How to Undo (Rollback)**:
  - In Git: `git revert <commit-hash>`.
