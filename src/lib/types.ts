 * EventLens AI — Core TypeScript Type Definitions
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * This file defines all the shared data models used throughout the EventLens
 * platform. Every component, API route, and utility function references these
 * types to ensure end-to-end type safety from the database layer to the UI.
 *
 * DATA FLOW OVERVIEW:
 *   Supabase Cloud DB  ──►  db.ts (queries)  ──►  Types below  ──►  React Components
 *   LocalStorage cache  ──►  db.ts (fallback) ──►  Types below  ──►  React Components
 *
 * CONNECTIONS:
 *   - Used by: db.ts, supabase.ts, faceRecognition.ts, zipDownload.ts
 *   - Used by all components: EventCard, GalleryGrid, FaceSearchModal, BulkUploader, Lightbox, QRCodeModal
 *   - Used by all pages: /, /event/[id], /admin, /admin/upload/[id]

 *   3. Displayed as cards on the landing page and admin dashboard
 *   4. Each event has its own public gallery page at /event/{slug}

 *   - Queried by: page.tsx (home) → getAllEvents() in db.ts
 *   - Viewed at: event/[id]/page.tsx → getEventById() in db.ts
